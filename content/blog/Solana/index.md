> Solana proposes a new way to keep track of time, using a
blockchain. The blockchain is a ledger, it's like a big book that
keeps track of when things happen. The blockchain can be used
with computers to make sure that things happen in the right order.
A blockchain is a special kind of book that keeps track of things that happen in time.<iframe src="https://play.ht/embed/?article_url=https://play.ht/drafts/ExdBebup5aXfznw5CogMnJW3E262/MknZ7KRc5&voice=en-US_AllisonV3Voice" scrolling="no" height="90px" width="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Abstract: This paper proposes a new blockchain architecture based on Proof
of History (PoH) - a proof for verifying order and passage of time
between events. PoH is used to encode trustless passage of time into
a ledger, with the combination of PoRep and PoH provides a defense
against forgery of the ledger with respect to time (ordering) and storage. The protocol is analyzed on a 1 gbps network, and this paper
shows that throughput up to 710k transactions per second is possible
with todays hardware.
