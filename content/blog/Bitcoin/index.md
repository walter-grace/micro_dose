This is my first post on Bitcoin. A summarization or microdose of what Bitcoin is.


# “What is Bitcoin?”

> 1. In a nutshell, how would you describe Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network for electronic cash. It is the first decentralized
payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen.

2.  #### What is Bitcoin's biggest challenge?
Bitcoin has a number of challenges, but the biggest one is probably the
perception that it is a plaything for criminals. The Silk Road, MtGox, and
Other incidents have given Bitcoin a reputation for being a hotbed for illicit activity.

3. #### Explain Bitcoin to my 70 year old Grandpa.
Bitcoin is a digital currency that you can use to buy things over the internet.

4. #### What do you think is the biggest misconception about Bitcoin?
I think the biggest misconception is that Bitcoin is used only by criminals.

5. #### What is a blockchain?
A blockchain is a transaction database shared by all nodes participating in a
system based on the Bitcoin protocol. A full copy of a currency's block
database contains every transaction ever executed in the currency. With this
information, one can find out how much value belonged to each address at any
point in history.

6. #### How do I understand the Proof-of-Work, is it legit miners?
People often make the mistake of thinking that miners create bitcoins. This is
false. Miners create blocks which contain a list of all the transactions which have
occurred in the past 10 minutes. They are awarded bitcoins for this work by the
network. The network itself creates bitcoins.
The proof-of-work is a piece of data which is costly and time-consuming to produce
so as to satisfy certain requirements. It must be trivial to check if data satisfies
these requirements. Producing a proof-of-work can be a random process with low
predictability and no better than random chance. Bitcoin uses the Hashcash proof-of-
work system.

8. #### What is mining?
Mining is the process of spending computation power to secure Bitcoin transactions
against reversal and introducing new Bitcoins to the system.
9. #### Explain Bitcoin to a 5th grader.
Bitcoin is a digital currency. It's like normal money, that you can use to buy
things and stuff, but only online. It doesn't exist in the real world. It only
exists online. You can't hold it in your hands. It's like if you had a piece of gold,
but it's digital. You can use it to buy things online.
