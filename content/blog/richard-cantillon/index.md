##### tl;dr: Cantillon was a proto-Austrian who was way ahead of his time.

Richard Cantillon was the first to systematically analyze the nature of the market process and the role of entrepreneurs in the economy. He is an early and important contributor to the Austrian School of economics. He is a forerunner of Menger and Mises, and his work is an important source of the subjective theory of value. He is also a forerunner of the Chicago School of economics.


## Early In Life

- Cantillon's career in banking began when he was serving as an assistant to British Paymaster James Bridges during the War of Spanish Succession. His work at the War of Spanish Succession exposed him to government inefficiency and corruption. He also traveled through Europe during the War, which may have sparked his interest in cultural differences.

- Cantillon had a second career as a Parisian banker, which began in the service of his elder cousin's bank. His cousin eventually had to sign over his bank to Cantillon and declare bankruptcy in 1716. In a lost manuscript, "Observations on the Trade and Luxury of Both Nations," Cantillon blamed conditions on the opulence and heavy war debts of Britain and France.


### 5th Grade Summary

> Richard Cantillon was a banker from Ireland who wrote a book called "Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en General" which is sometimes called the "Cradle of Political Economy." He was a smart man who understood economics a lot better than other people at the time. He was murdered in 1734.

### The Essai

Cantillon's Essai is considered influential for the development of both the Physiocrats and the classical economists, and Cantillon was one of the very few people mentioned by Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations.

Unfortunately, Smith misrepresented Cantillon's work. Both Cantillon and his Essai were largely forgotten during the period of classical economics. The true significance of the Essai was gleaned by the French economists A.R.J. Turgot and J.B. Say, who were important precursors to the modern Austrian School. Since his rediscovery during the marginalist revolution, a substantial body of literature has grown up in appreciation of Cantillon and a number of mysteries surrounding him and the Essai have been solved. 

Cantillon's Essai is one of the most important works in the history of economics. It is a work that has been completely overlooked by the economics profession, and it has been largely forgotten by the general public. Yet it is a work that deserves to be read and studied by all economists. Cantillon's contributions to economics are numerous and profound. His contributions to the method of economics, while unappreciated in his time and largely forgotten, are truly remarkable when placed in historical context.


#### Intrinsic value in Cantillon Eyes

Cantillon's views on intrinsic value are very clear in the Essai. He is not an objective value theorist, but rather a subjective value theorist. The value of a good is determined by the resources sacrificed to produce it. The value of a good is not determined by its objective properties, but rather by the subjective preferences of the people. The value of a good is not determined by its objective properties, but rather by the subjective preferences of the people. The value of a good is not determined by its objective properties, but rather by the subjective preferences of the people. The value of a good is not determined by its objective properties, but rather by the subjective preferences of the people.

>"If you want to buy something, you have to have money. And to get money, you have to sell something. If you want to buy a toy, you have to sell something else. You have to sell your time (by working) or sell your stuff (by selling your stuff). You can't just sit on your butt and wait for the money to come to you."

Cantillon was the first to demonstrate that the market process is a spontaneous order.The Scottish philosopher and tax collector Adam Smith should no longer be considered the father of economics. That title now belongs to the Irish entrepreneur and Austrian economist, Richard Cantillon.
