1. What is Plaid
- Plaid is a company that helps banks and other financial services companies make it easier for third-party companies to make apps that you can use to do things like check your bank account, pay someone, or get a credit card.

- It's like the plumbing in your house. Plaid makes sure that the pipes are connected to the right places.
2. What Apps use Plaid
- Cash App, Venmo
3. How did you find success?
- We built a tool that let financial services companies do their jobs better.
- And we got lucky, because a lot of people wanted to use our tool.
4. What did your product look like to start?
- Started as a consumer app that helps you manage your money better but then you realized that the banks are the hub for your financial life and that the banks are not as good as they should be at connecting all the apps you use to manage your money so you became a platform that connects all those apps to the bank account.
