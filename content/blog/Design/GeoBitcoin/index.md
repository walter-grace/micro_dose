# Laying out geopolitics of BTC and its rise in the MMT future.

As we have learned throughout history many times before, paper money will at some point lose confidence. It is a trade-off in providing the entire world with a currency we risk the falling purchasing power if our USD becomes less used today than before.

 

### disclaimer: "not predicting anything or saying the world is going to end"

My observation has been noticing a trend in which it is highly plausible that we see a world in which China returns to or attempts a gold-back Yuan. If they do such a thing, it will only mean it is an attempt to generate more **confidence** in their currency. 

A counter move the USA needs to implore is the idea that Gold is merely a religious relic. The critic might say, " but is thou Bitcoin not thy Same?" In the ability to discuss nuance it is not.

Bitcoin makes sending money anywhere with internet access an easy possibility to transmit money across the globe.

The other benefit that Bitcoin has developed is that, for now, it seems to be a great way to hedge against speculative attacks on your native currency. If your native currency is in constant flux then Bitcoin might actually be a safer currency. 

My goal is not to get you to take out loans and loans to buy Bitcoin. It is to reason an awareness of a silent fight going on, it is the **Currency War**.

# the silent War

the war that is taking place in the central banks is one that has been going on for sometime now. It is one in the rise of CCP in China and their goal to destroy confidence in the USD and instill greater confidence in the Yuan. The move to gold backed currency would greatly increase the legitimacy and optics of a currency that isn't totally at the control of a government. While it wouldn't change much in the transparency of such information. The most logical counter move would be to erode the trust in gold while going the opposite end rooted in "trust" via the blockchain, Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the next evolution of what gold provided. The game theory of Bitcoin that will play out needs to happen in the States, ideally in the smaller states that could benefit from the externalities of enabling Bitcoin payments. Mining bitcoin with external flaring from natural gas plants is incredibly important. That alone could not only cut down on emission, it also economically makes sense. 

# What does this mean for Bitcoin?

It means soon Bitcoin will have to step up to a 9-10 trillion dollar market. The way Bitcoin has taken over the entire digital realm is one of the reasons we must look to counter the rise of any gold backed currencies. A wonderful more optimistic view of what the US should do is well articulated in this article 

[The Fiat Dollar System Is No Privilege: The Burden And Why The U.S. Will Adopt Bitcoin](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.amp/markets/how-bitcoin-could-replace-the-u-s-dollar)

to keep it brief, the larger trends all seem to be pointing back to a need to build back and not be so focused on the global economy. Bitcoin would be the most obvious way to challenge the trust of gold and maintain the openness of the USD.
